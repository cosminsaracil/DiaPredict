Cell 1: Environment Setup and Data Loading

Setting up the environment. It imports essential Python libraries required for data analysis, manipulation, and visualization, ensuring that all necessary tools are available for subsequent steps in your pipeline.
Verifying the environment. It prints details about the Python environment, such as the executable path, version, and site packages, which helps confirm that the correct environment is being usedâ€”a useful check for reproducibility or debugging.
Loading the dataset: It specifies the path to a CSV file containing diabetes-related data, checks if the file exists, and loads it into a pandas DataFrame for further processing. It also provides a quick preview of the data by displaying column names and the first few rows.

Important note. The data is loaded locally because of the nature of the dataset. If you plan to use this code make sure to make a copy of the dataset available on Kaggle.

Cell 4: Unique Values per Column

This cell performs a straightforward yet insightful task in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It counts the number of unique values per column and presents the results in a neat, readable format.
